```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model WEIGHT ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(WEIGHT~NECK,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```


## Compare all models that predict WEIGHT other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better. 

```{r}
simp1 <- lm(WEIGHT~CHEST,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~CHEST,data=bears)
abline(simp1)
summary.lm(simp1)
```

The predicted overall weight of a bear based on chest has an adjusted R-Squared value of 0.9262, and a Residual standard error value of 33.08. 

```{r}
simp2 <- lm(WEIGHT~LENGTH,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~LENGTH,data=bears)
abline(simp2)
summary.lm(simp2)
```

The predicted overall weight of a bear based on length has an adjusted R-Squared value of 0.7423, and a Residual standard error of 61.83.

```{r}
simp3 <- lm(WEIGHT~HEADWTH,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~HEADWTH,data=bears)
abline(simp3)
summary.lm(simp3)
```

The predicted overall weight of a bear based on headwidth has an adjusted R-Squared value of 0.6064, and a Residual standard error of 76.41.

```{r}
simp4 <- lm(WEIGHT~HEADLEN,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~HEADLEN,data=bears)
abline(simp4)
summary.lm(simp4)
```

The predicted overall weight of a bear based on head length has an adjusted R-Squared value of 0.69, and a Residual standard error of 67.81.

```{r}
simp5 <- lm(WEIGHT~AGE,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~AGE,data=bears)
abline(simp5)
summary.lm(simp5)
```

The predicted overall weight of a bear based on head length has an adjusted R-Squared value of 0.561, and a Residual standard error of 81.47.


## CONCLUSION AND RANKING

According to the data I collected for the adjusted R squared and Residual standard error values when I compared weight to all other numerical values, the ranking is as such: 

1. WEIGHT~CHEST: RSE: 33.08 and ARS:0.9262
2. WEIGHT~NECK: RSE: 43.91 and ARS: 0.87
3. WEIGHT~LENGTH: RSE: 61.83 and ARS: 0.7423
4. WEIGHT~HEAD LENGTH:RSE: 67.81 and ARS: 0.69
5. WEIGHT~HEAD WIDTH: RSE: 76.41 and ARS: 0.6064
6. WEIGHT~AGE: RSE: 81.47 and ARS:0.5526
